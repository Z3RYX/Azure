# Azure for Discord Hack-Week 2019
![NOTICE](https://img.shields.io/badge/IMPORTANT0%20NOTICE-SERIOUS%20BUGS-critical.svg)  
**This repo contains a lot of untested features and therefore a handful of bot breaking bugs! I DECLARE THIS SUBMISSION AS DISQUALIFIED AS IT WILL NOT WORK AT ALL WHEN COMPILED AND RUN! I am currently working on those bugs and once the results for Hack-Week are in, I will commit the fixed version. The official bot hosted by me will have these fixes way earlier.**

Azure is a moderation bot written in C# using Discord.Net  
This is a project for Discord Hack-Week 2019
